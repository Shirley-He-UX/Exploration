     "ALL men by nature desire to know. An indication of this is the delight we take in our senses; for even apart from their usefulness they are loved for themselves; and above all others the sense of sight. For not only with a view to action, but even when we are not going to do anything, we prefer seeing (one might say) to everything else. The reason is that this, most of all the senses, makes us know and brings to light many differences between things. "

3.found problems & solutions

    (1) How to recoganize whether the mouse is hovering over the irregular figures through the SVG or PNG pictures
    
    (2) How to determine the accurate time of trasition parts
    
    (3) The canvas elements are hard to bind the mouse events with them, dom elemnts maybe easier but it's hard to draw the shapes without canvas
